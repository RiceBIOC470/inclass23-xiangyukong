%In this directory, you will find a derivaitve function representing a
%three gene circuit in which each gene product represses the transcription of another
%gene in a cycle. This simple three gene circuit displays oscillations and was one
%of the first synthetic circuits ever constructed (see Elowitz & Leibler
%Nature 2000). 

% 1. Start with initial conditions x(1) = 1, x(2) = x(3) = 0. 
% Run the model for 200 time units and plot the result. verify that it
% does indeed oscillate. 
% 2. What happens if you start with initial conditions x(1) = x(2) = x(3) =
% 0.5? Why?
% 3. The strength of the repression is governed by the constant k2 which is
% the same for all the genes. What happens when you make k2 larger or
% smaller? Find the approximate value of k2 for which the system no longer
% oscillates. 
% 4. What happens when you make k2 larger or smaller for only one of the
% genes?
